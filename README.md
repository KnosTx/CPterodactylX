# Pryodactilus

> Forked from [pterodactly/panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel), version 1.0.0-beta.1 licensed under MIT.

Pyrodactilus was formerly an open-source game server management panel called Pterodactyl. We aim to replace the provided UI with our custom fronted called [palutena](https://github.com/uphoriadev/palutena) and only keep the API and our changes.


## Getting started

At this time, Pyrodactilus can be launched the same way as Pterodactyl.

Support can be found on our [their documentation](https://pterodactyl.io/project/introduction.html). Please head to [their repository](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel) for further information.
